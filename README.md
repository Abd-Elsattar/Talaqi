# Talaqi-Platform
ITI Project Graduation
Our project is a smart platform for managing all lost and found items in Egypt.
The platform brings together all types of lost items in one place: personal items (cellphones, bags, papers), people (children, the elderly, people with disabilities), and even pets.
The goal is to create a reliable and smart system that helps people find their lost items quickly and safely, relying on artificial intelligence technologies for image recognition, description matching, and location analysis.
This will make us the first comprehensive platform in Egypt for managing and retrieving lost items.
